<h2 style="color: beige; font-size: 14pt">&boxUR; Repository Description &boxUL;  </h2>
<p>Herein lies one of the most complex and interesting repositories you will find in this profile (for now). My data structures
and algorithm course has been a blast, learning about so many solutions, implementations, and possible avenues for problem 
solving has been hard just because I don’t have enough hours in a day to study all the topics I would like to</p>
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, the files that I present here include various "dissertations" to put it some way about topics like Trees, Sorting Algorithms,
External Sorting, Linear Data Structures, etc. While they’re certainly not finished, I figured putting these out there would 
inevitably help someone out.
<br>
<br>
Here are some important details for those who wish to delve into the files!
</p>
<ul>
<code>File Structure</code>
<li><b style="color: cornflowerblue; font-weight: bold">Homework Modules</b>: For the time being these are all <b>past></b> homework 
assignments in the off-chance someone tries to grab them and pass them as their own. These include implementations
for linear and non-linear data structures as well as algorithms and comparisons of them.</li>
<li><b style="color: cornflowerblue; font-weight: bold">Practice Modules</b>: These include most of my personal practice code,
be it implementations for algorithms or data structures, or random tests like NFAs in Java. These files showcase most of the work
and the importance I give to practicing and applying concepts learned in class</li>
<li><b style="color: cornflowerblue; font-weight: bold">Theory Markdowns</b>: While not exhaustive by any means, these 
include markdown files for each class up to the first commit of this repo. I think the better ones start coming 
up after class 13th, where the real coursework began with complex data structures.</li>
<code>Content</code>
<li><b style="color: cornflowerblue; font-weight: bold">Implementations</b>: most of the implementations were based of 
one out of five books that I’ve been using for this class, and constantly look back to when I need to understand the theory
behind some decision I took in my code.</li>
<li><b style="color: cornflowerblue; font-weight: bold">Updates</b>: the content in this repository will most likely be updated 
every other day, given that making Markdown documents that are 2000 lines long takes time (!). However, I will try to make 
updates regular so that knowledge and implementations can be shared and reuse (I do not claim my implementations are the best,
but I try to make them work appropriately and efficiently)</li>
</ul>
